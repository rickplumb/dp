phase 2

The Google tag manager on the /aboutus & /survey pages has gone well, the tags are in place ready for when the code is released.

Can I put the next request in the backlog please. I would like the same GTM code added to the pages & sub-pages of:

/census
/help
/news

Census pages will be the highest profile here, but the content on the pages appears to be quite straightforward.

phase 3:

I would like to implement Google Tag Manager code on all Dataset pages, these are pages with /datasets/ in the URL.

â€¢ As part of this I'd like some items added to the DataLayer. There's details on how to code this here; https://developers.google.com/tag-manager/devguide. (We've already done it once on Data Discovery)

The items are;
1) The dataset title
2) The release date (in yyyy/mm/dd format)
3) The title of the publication that uses this data - accessed on the Right nav under 'Publications that use this data'

For example, on the page https://www.ons.gov.uk/economy/inflationandpriceindices/datasets/consumerpriceindices, the dataLayer would be

<script>
dataLayer = [{
'datasetTitle': 'Consumer Price Inflation time series dataset',
'releaseDate':'2017/05/16',
'publicationTitle': 'UK consumer price inflation : Apr 2017'
}];
</script>
